# My-Arduino-UNO-Design

## Contents and Overview

During this project, I deepened and honed my knowledge about Altium Designer software. Altium Designer is a professional software used to design all kinds of boards, from very simple ones to motherboards or servers. It is one of the most used software for electronic design.

I started with Arduino Uno reference schematic. I learned how to re-draw the schematic, modify it, I learned how to improve it and how to do PCB layout. and by the end of the project, I learned what documents are necessary to manufacture the board and how to create them.

during this project, I learned how :

- Draw schematic, including tips for component selection and important circuits
- Create components, draw schematic symbols and footprints
- Place components into your PCB
- Route PCB and useful tips about layout
- Create a 3D model of your board
- Create board variants with different components fitted / not fitted
- Create Bill of Material (BOM)
- Create assembly drawings showing the position of components on the board
- Generate Gerbers, Pick and Place, Drill file, and other files needed for manufacturing
- Prepare professional documents needed to manufacture your PCB and assemble your board
